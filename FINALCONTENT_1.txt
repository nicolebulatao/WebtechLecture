Java EE
	open, standard-based development and deployment platform for creating 
	distribute, transactional, reliable, secure, multitiered, web-based, 
	server-centric, component-based enterprise applications

Java EE Application Model
	Java programming language, Java Virtual Machine (JVM)
	Java EE Component
		Java EE Clients
			Application Clients, Applets (embedded in web clients)
		Web Components
			Servlets, JavaServer Pages (JSP), JavaServer Faces (JSF)
			invoked on the servlet by the servlet container when the 
			servlet is to be unloaded (e.g when the application a stopped
			or undeployed) can be used by the servlets for clean-up processing (resource dealocation)
		Servlet Request Processing (HttpServletRequest)
			Retrieving user-supplied request parameters
			Retrieving request header values
		Servlet Response Processing (HttpServletResponse)
			Setting response status code
			Setting response headers
			Obtaining output object for sending the response
		Servlet Request Dispatching (RequestDispatcher)
			Obtain a RequestDispatcher to a resource (static or dynamic) from the request object
			
					RequestDispatcher rqstDsp;
					rstDsp = request. getRequestDispatcher(res);
					
			Include the dispatcher resource (or its output) in the current response. one or more resources
			can be included (e.g use for banners, footers, etc.)
			
					rstDsp.include (request, response);
			
			Forwards the processing of the current request to be the dispatcher resource, 
			the servlet processing the current request must not generate a response (e.g use in MVC "controller" servlets)
				
					rstDsp.forward (request, response);


Session Tracking (HttpSession)
		Session Tracking support is implemented either cookies or URL-rewriting
		Obtain session object form the current request
		
			HttpSession session;
			
			session = requests.getSession(createNew);
		
		Obtaining session information (HttpSession)
			getCreationTime(), getLastAccessedTime(), getMaxInactiveInternal()
			getId(), isNew(), setMaxInactiveInternal (int val)
		
		destroying sessions
			invalidate()
			
		URL-rewriting(HttpServletResponse)
			encodeURL(String url), encodeRedirectURL(String url)
			

Web Context (ServletContext)
		a web application is associated with a context, which is an object that provides methods
		that servlets use to communicate with servlet container 
		
		obtaining the servlet context(HttpServlet)
