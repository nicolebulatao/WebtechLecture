SERVER-SIDE WEB SCRIPTING AND HTTP SERVLET

========== April 17, 2018 (Tuesday)\b0  \b |\b0  \b Server-side Web Scripting ==========

- not only one but
- multiple platforms, technology

Java Servlets -> JAVA EE
(used in creating web app)

- handles client requests by generating
- hosted in a 'servlet - container' that provides the environment in which servlet runs
(*two packages, javax.servlet and ...)
- smethods -> servlet response and servlet request
(serve any request from client)

destruction - destroy() method
(invoked before the servlet instance is 'unloaded', and is intended for any housekeeping cod.)

HttpServlet
- Java servlet used to handle HTTP requests and generate HTTP Responses...
- Hosted in a 'web container', which is a component in a Java 'application server' (e.g. Apache)
- the service() , method call is routed to a doXXX() claa, depending on HTTP request method, e.g. doGET(), doPOST().

HttpServlet Response
- object representation of the HTTP Response.
- list of Java application servers
- tomcat
- glassfish

Java Web (in netbeans) the steps:
Application
* (tick) - use dedicated folder for string libraries
* server - tomcat
* Java EE version - JAVA EE 7
	in your project
* Server package - servlet
(for the deployment (war file was discussed i am not sure pero search na lang natin))

Servlet output stream
(served to the client)

server side resources
(stores the resources)

================= April 20, 2018 (Friday) server side =================
- process multipart data (@MultipartConfig)\fs24\lang13321\par
- servlet (multimedia) will make database connection object 
 * shared objects
public interface ServletContext
- associated with
- have multiple listener
*getAttribute()
*setAttribute()
servletContextListener()
* contextDestroyed(ServletContextEvent sce)
* contextInitialized(ServletContextEvent sce)
- sharable
Connection (every servlet associated with the inside servletContext will havea connection to "dbConn")

contextDestroyed (ServletContextEvent sce)
{
ServletContext context = sce.getServletContext();
Connection dbCon

(advantage is that if i change a connection, only one servlet will be affected)

- For every Java application there is web.xml (that can be configured) can even define error page (status code) for a particular page
- if backend is change, change parameter value. (Don't worry the code will not be changed.)

---------------

String connstr = context.getInitParameter("connstrr")
comes from a xml configuration (its not hard coded.)

(the html files in the Java Servlet package)
(index.html)
<input type = "hidden" >


(GetProducts.java)
Product.java
- (simply get the request and process data and associate with array list of java.)
- (this arraylist can be sent to any servlet that requires this category)
- get the request 
- manipulate the data
- process it and display into the interface
- Frontend doesn't have to ask about the data/structure from the backend

-----
- request setAttribute (share attribute)
- passed to my current request and include it sa arraylist

Request Dispatcher
- sends them to the servlet

Forward
- forward with correspinding respond error.
(ShowHTML.java) (view = html)
dbimages - logical, where images can be acquired

----------

String prodId = get the request

SSI - is used, may fragment di lang request pwedeng mag include (by using the request dispatcher)

* javascript is used
ShowJSON.java(string object) (it creates object/string json (look at index.html))
convert using json.parse

use dynamic content via AJAX(w database access)
